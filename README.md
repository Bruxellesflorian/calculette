## Let's build a calculator

Using what we know about javascript, we're going to build a simple calculator app.

# What did we do ?
- Create a new repository named `calculator`
- Create a `calculator.js` file.
- Create a file named `index.html`. In the `<body>` you can only put an empty `<main>` tag, and the link to your javascript file. The rest of the app has to be generated using your script
- You have to generate a calculator layout with a display on top and all the digits buttons (0 to 9), the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `x`, `/`), a button to calculate the result (`=`) and a button to clear the display (`C`)
- Clicking on the button should emulate the behavior of a calculator.
